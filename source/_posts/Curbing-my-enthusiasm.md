> "The scope of thoughts you can write is much broader than the scope of thoughts you can think on your own. Written language, much like computer code, can express programs that are out of reach for brains alone. Write to think." — **François Chollet** [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet)

After more than a whole year, I'm finally bringing back this website online. Inspired by [this](https://blog.yitianshijie.net/2017/08/13/yitianshijie-newsletter-78/),  writings here will not only be academic notes this time. 

Instead of randomly throwing a few words accompanied by some funny pics on twitter/wechat and totally dropping the ideas afterwards, writing and posting here is expected to give birth to deeper and wider thoughts. 

Hence, I'm practicing to curb my enthusiasm.
